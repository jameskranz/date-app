# Product Guidelines: DATE

## 1. Visual Style & Branding
- **Core Aesthetic:** Nostalgic, tactile, and playful.
- **Background:** A "notebook paper" texture (lightly lined or grid).
- **Typography:** Primary fonts should mimic handwriting or high-quality script; secondary fonts should be clean and legible (e.g., sans-serif).
- **Color Palette:** Warm, paper-like tones with pops of color for interactive elements (e.g., marker-style "X" marks for elimination).

## 2. Interaction Design
- **Mobile First:** All interactive elements (inputs, buttons, library items) must be large and "thumb-friendly."
- **Gamification:** The core loop (input -> spiral -> result) should feel like a game, not a form. Use animations to heighten anticipation during the elimination phase.
- **Spiral Mechanic:** The "Magic Number" generation must be a tactile, press-and-hold experience that provides visual feedback (e.g., drawing a spiral).

## 3. Copy & Voice
- **Tone:** Encouraging, nostalgic, and low-friction.
- **Persona:** A helpful, playful friend who takes the stress out of planning.
- **Clarity:** Use simple, direct labels for categories and actions.

## 4. Layout & Navigation
- **Single Page Feel:** Minimize full-page reloads. Use smooth transitions between the Setup, Gameplay, and Result views.
- **History View:** Present past games as a scrollable timeline of "Date Cards" that can be easily revisited.

## 5. Accessibility & Performance
- **Contrast:** Ensure "handwritten" text remains readable against the textured background.
- **Responsiveness:** Seamlessly adapt from smartphone screens to tablets.
- **Low Latency:** Gameplay animations and library interactions must feel snappy and responsive.
